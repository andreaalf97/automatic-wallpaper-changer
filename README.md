# automatic-wallpaper-changer
### This is a script that automatically changes your desktop background with the latest pictures from [r/MinimalWallpaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinimalWallpaper/)

This version is able to download and save all the .jpg and .png pictures that are hosted on [Reddit](www.reddit.com) in a local folder called `images`, but still has problems with those hosted on [Imgur](http://imgur.com/)

I am currently working on timing the script and making it set the picture as a wallpaper slideshow.

To try it just clone this repo locally and type:
```
npm start
```
